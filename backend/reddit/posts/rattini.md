# Rattini Tribe - Relentlessly feeding capitals in a target rich environment 

*A cult of Minmatar pilots who worship a fictional deity, the Rat, who they believe is the source of their strength. Minmatar scientists speculate that a decade of failed mind state record scans in the heat of wormhole combat have altered their capsuleer memory banks permanantly. Quite literally, they have brain damage.*

# Overview

[Rattini Tribe](https://my.minmatar.org/alliance/corporations/list/#Rattini_Tribe) is the founding corporation of [Minmatar Fleet Alliance](https://my.minmatar.org/), a content powerhouse in the southern lowsec region.

With over 150 humans in our corporation, we offer,

* **Full timezone coverage**. AUTZ, EUTZ, USTZ.
* **Unlimited content.** Alongside the firehose of solo and small gang content in faction warfare, we're also fighting multiple nullblocs (FRT, RMC) and lowsec coalitions.
* **Ridiculous income sources**. With alliance support, our pilots are somehow yolo'ing multiple dreads a week. Weird, right?

In addition to military presence, Rattini Tribe is at the heart of alliance industry- we play a large part in fueling the 500b/mo machine that is Minmatar Fleet Alliance.

# Culture

Originally founded from the executors of top wormhole alliances, Rattini Tribe was meant to be a "breath of fresh air" from the sweatiness of wormhole space. With a casual feel and accepting environment, most pilots find themselves at home in Rattini Tribe.

>"By gnawing through a dike, even a rat may drown a nation."- Mortarian Decala, spooling his second boosh

In our ranks of rats, you'll find hardcore wormholer refugees, retired nullsec bloc fcs, and even players who have just discovered the beauty of EVE Online.

# Mentality

Rattini Tribe focuses on fun for ourselves and our enemies, which is why we're such a chaotic opponent. Even if we've just lost 100 billion ISK in dreads, you'll hear "can we go again?" in comms, ready with replacement dreads.

>"99% of rats quit before they get the cheese."- Casper Sullivan, after gambling 200B on the Hypernet

No content is too far, and our wallets are never empty. We always take the fight, and are constantly looking for our next source of cheese.
